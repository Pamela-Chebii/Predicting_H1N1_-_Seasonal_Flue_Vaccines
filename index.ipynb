    "- These are the input variables that your model will use to predict the probability that people received H1N1 flu and seasonal flu vaccines. There are 35 feature columns in total, each a response to a survey question. These questions cover several different topics, such as whether people observed safe behavioral practices, their opinions about the diseases and the vaccines, and their demographics. Check out the problem description page for more information.\n",

    "**Training Labels**:\n",
    "- These are the labels corresponding to the observations in the training features. There are two target variables: h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine. Both are binary variables, with 1 indicating that a person received the respective flu vaccine and 0 indicating that a person did not receive the respective flu vaccine. Note that this is what is known as a \"multilabel\" modeling task.\n",

    "**Test Features**:\n",

    "**Submission Format**:\n",
    "- This file serves as an example for how to format your submission. It contains the index and columns for our submission prediction. The two target variable columns are filled with 0.5 and 0.7 as an example. Your submission to the leaderboard must be in this exact format (with different prediction values) in order to be scored successfully!"
