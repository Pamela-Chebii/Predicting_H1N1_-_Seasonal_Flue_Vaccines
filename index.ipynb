    "### **`Introduction`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccination is a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases.It is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting a person against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them (WHO, 2024). Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through \"herd immunity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "Mpox, just like covid 19 that affected the entire world in 2020,  is a new viral infection which can spread between people, mainly through close contact, and occasionally from the environment to people via things and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox (WHO, 2024). It is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus. 3 cases of Mpox at the time of writing this have been reported in Kenya but the vaccines for the disease are still under development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this research on uptake of vaccines based on opinions, demoraphics and doctor's recommendation is from United States National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey collected to monitor vaccination rates during the US Government Vaccination Campaign that began in October 2009. A phone survey was used to ask people whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with information they shared about their lives, opinions, and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Objectives`**\n",
    "- To predict whether people got H1N1 and Seasonal Flue Vaccines using infromation shared about their backgrounds, opinions and Health Behaviour.\n",
    "- To determine the best performing model in predicting Vaccines\n"

    "Here, the different sets of data as downloaded from the **`DRIVENDATA`** data repository are described:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Features**: \n",
    "- These are the input variables that the model will use to predict the probability that people received H1N1 flu and seasonal flu vaccines. There are 35 feature columns in total, each a response to a survey question. These questions cover several different topics, such as whether people observed safe behavioral practices, their opinions about the diseases and the vaccines, and their demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Labels**:\n",
    "- These are the labels corresponding to the observations in the training features. There are two target variables: h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine. Both are binary variables, with 1 indicating that a person received the respective flu vaccine and 0 indicating that a person did not receive the respective flu vaccine. This is a \"multilabel\" modeling task.\n",

    "- The AUC score on the test data (**Red Curve**) initially increases along with the training AUC, indicating that the model is generalizing well to unseen data at the start until it starts to decline the depth of about 7 even as the Train AUC continues to rise.\n",

    "- The decline in the performance of the Test Data whereas the training data performance continues to increase indicate that the model has become overfitted.\n",

    "- The performance of the model has significantly improved (83% auc_roc score) compaired to the second and third models which were both decision tree models but had a performance of 69% and 78% respectively.\n",
    "- This improvement in performance is attributed to the use of more features and the use of correct depth limit achieved through hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- The model however, has thesame performance when compaired to the Logistic Regression model that had a performance score of 83% despite model four having more features than the Logistic Regression Model.\n",
    "- To further improve the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier, other tree prunning methods like (minimum samples with leaf split, minimum leaf sample size, maximum leaf nodes, and maximum features) can be used instead of using miaximum depth alone."

    "### **`FINDINGS`**\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression Model has an average roc_auc score of 83.07% indicating that the model performs well in predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines uptake\n",
    "2. The Vanilla Decision Tree Model has an roc_auc score of 69% which is a poor performance compaired to the logistic regression model. This indicate that use of less variables without hypeperameter tuning results to poor model performance in Decision Trees.\n",
    "3. The tuned decision tree using similar features as the Vanilla model had a n roc_auc score of 78% indicating that proper prunning of decision tree can lead to good performance of a model\n",
    "4. The tuned decision tree that was developed using an optimal depth with more three more features (`sex`, `race` and `age_group`) compaired to the logistic regression that had only 23 features performed better than all the models  (roc_auc of 83.12%). This indicate that with proper tuning and increasing the number features the model ca perform better in predicting vaccines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Recommendations`**\n",
    "1. When performing hypeparameter tuning for the decision tree classifier, only the Maximum Depth was used. To improve the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier, other tree prunning methods like (minimum samples with leaf split, minimum leaf sample size, maximum leaf nodes, and maximum features) can be used instead of using miaximum depth alone.\n",
    "2. The decision tree classifier used only one target variable (seasonal_vaccine). Both outcomes can be included in the decision tree model to determine whether the model performance will improve."
