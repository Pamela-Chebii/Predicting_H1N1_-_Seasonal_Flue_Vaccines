    "- These are the input variables that your model will use to predict the probability that people received H1N1 flu and seasonal flu vaccines. There are 35 feature columns in total, each a response to a survey question. These questions cover several different topics, such as whether people observed safe behavioral practices, their opinions about the diseases and the vaccines, and their demographics. Check out the problem description page for more information.\n",

    "**Training Labels**:\n",
    "- These are the labels corresponding to the observations in the training features. There are two target variables: h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine. Both are binary variables, with 1 indicating that a person received the respective flu vaccine and 0 indicating that a person did not receive the respective flu vaccine. Note that this is what is known as a \"multilabel\" modeling task.\n",

    "- This file serves as an example for how to format your submission. It contains the index and columns for our submission prediction. The two target variable columns are filled with 0.5 and 0.7 as an example. Your submission to the leaderboard must be in this exact format (with different prediction values) in order to be scored successfully!"

    "- The performance of the model has significantly improved (76% Accuracy score) compaired to the second and third models which were both decision tree models but had a performance of 69% and 73% respectively.\n",
    "- This improvement in performance is attributed to the use of more features and the use of correct depth limit achieved through hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- The model however, still doesn't perform well compaired to the Logistic Regression model that had a performance score of 83% despite model four having more features than the Logistic Regression Model.\n",
    "- To further improve the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier, other tree prunning methods like (minimum samples with leaf split, minimum leaf sample size, maximum leaf nodes, and maximum features) can be used instead of using miaximum depth alone."
